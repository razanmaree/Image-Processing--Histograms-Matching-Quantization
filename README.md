# Image-Processing--Histograms-Matching-Quantization
In this question, weâ€™ll need to identify numbers, quantify the histogram bins, and measure the numbers they represent.
Our dataset consists of images of grade histograms and images of the 10 digits. We aim to use those digit images to recognize the digits in the histogram images, get the relative bin heights in pixels and then retrieve the number of students per bin.
For example, the following image's output is: 1,1,1,3,1,2,9,3,3,0.
